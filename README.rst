WEAP model build
===========================================

This repository contains Python scripts that enables automatic WEAP model building for river catchments in Canterbury, New Zealand. These scripts aim
to make model building less time-consuming, and consistent among Canterbury's river catchments.

The scripts rely on data that exists in the databases of Environment Canterbury. A change to the structure of any of these databases means that some of
the scripts needs to be modified to be able to work with these databases changes.
